# bikeshare-project
This is the bikeshare analysis project done for the Udacity Data Analysis with R course.
The analysis has been copied from the Jupyter notebook to a local script. The local script does not generate an ipynb file.

This script requires the files chicago.csv, washington.csv, and new_york_city.csv, which can be obtained from Udacity.
